# Simple Node.js Web Server

# More about the server
Project aimed at creating a simple web server to allow a client to complete 3 distinct tasks

# Tasks
- Allow user to enter student details (student id, first name, last name, age, gender, degree) which is then stored in a csv file
- Allow user to search for all students completing a certain degree (user supplied)
- Allow user to select an image from their machine to upload to the server, then subsequently view the image

# Goals include 
- Implement simple web app/server using node.js
- Module design to promote greater reusability
- All implemented using core modules and one non-core module ([formidable](https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable "formidable"))
- AJAX used for client code so that page reloading isn't necessary

# Requirements
- Node.js runtime environment
- [formidable module](https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable "formidable") (non-core node.js module)
- Web browswer (so the client can access the server)
